# dd-opentracing-rs

Datadog Opentracing Rust Client

This is an in-progress implementation of the Datatog opentracing client. The implementation is fully based on the C++ [version](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-opentracing-cpp).

This repository also contains the Rust-based implementation of the Opentracing [specification](https://github.com/opentracing) as well. The goal of its implementation is to make it available through the <https://crates.io> eventually. The implementation is also based on the C++ [version](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-cpp).
